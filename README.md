## Attendance-System-
- The project is meant to create an advanced attendance taking system to help teachers,  students and college administration by automating the entire process.
- It is designed keeping  scalability and code- reusability in mind, which means that the same project can be altered  by changing few variables to get desired results.
- Furthermore, thereâ€™s scope of adding more  functionality without disturbing any of the existing one. This is made possible by using  Object Oriented Programming, a Modular for designing web service, and following large  parts of MVC model.
- This allows us to extend the project to mobile applications and other environments.
